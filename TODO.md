## TO DO

* Write some documentation.

* Test. Check that `length`, `get`, `foreach` and `to_seq` are consistent.

* Test. Check that `foreach` is faster than iterated `get`.

* Try implementing a balancing scheme for `Sum`?

* Define a combinator `smap` where the user function `f` has access to the
  size of the data.
