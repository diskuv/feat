(* This is an implementation of implicit finite sequences as objects, that is,
   records of closures. This is the implementation style proposed in the Feat
   paper by Duregard et al. *)

(* In this implementation, the constructors have time complexity O(1),
   under the assumption that the arithmetic operations provided by [Z]
   cost O(1) as well. *)
