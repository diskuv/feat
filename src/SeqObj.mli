open SeqSig

(* This is an implementation of sequences as objects, that is, records of
   closures. This is the implementation style proposed in the Feat paper
   by Duregard et al. *)

(* In this implementation, the constructors have time complexity O(1),
   under the assumption that the arithmetic operations provided by [Z]
   cost O(1) as well. *)
